It was developed at AOE to manage employee lunch meals. What initially started as a small tool has now grown in to a mature and enterprise ready application, and it&amp;rsquo;s still growing. It&amp;rsquo;s been open source ever since, and we love to share it.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
