&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>This robot contains an electronic and software interface that allows you to control or modify, and remotely monitor its sensors. For software programmers interested in giving your iRobot new functionality we encourage you to do so.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/fbrnc/status/889569236401741824">A little later I first started playing&lt;/a> with microcontrollers sending infrared commands to the IR sensor in order to start cleaning via my home network (or specifically by pressing one of the Amazon Dash buttons that came out at that time).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While newer generations of the Roomba product line already come with wifi and cameras I always wanted to be able to add that myself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Although it may sound a little over-engineered here&amp;rsquo;s my current project:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Under the top cover of the Roomba there&amp;rsquo;s a serial interface connector hidden. Using a &lt;a href="https://www.irobot.lv/uploaded_files/File/iRobot_Roomba_500_Open_Interface_Spec.pdf">documented serial interface&lt;/a> you can easily send either higher-level commands like start cleaning, stopping, and seeking the dock, or low-level commands like reading individual sensor values, controlling the motors or even playing notes on the internal speaker.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
