I do simply ask people if I notice them being interested (or even experts) in certain areas.</p><p>We track them all in Gitlab, that&rsquo;s where work happen anyway, so we don&rsquo;t spread over multiple tools. A gently reminder to be ready by next week helps everyone to have their topic prepared.</p><p>Second, make sure to not have a boring Dev-Weekly: focus on that one topic, have it teasered during the regular weekly, and you&rsquo;ll find half of the company joining and listening.</p><p>Eventually, make sure to record the presentation (if okay for the presenter), as people sometimes will miss it, and this gives everyone a chance to follow up.</p></div></div></div><div class="container my-20 mx-auto px-8 md:px-20"><div class="flex flex-row mx-auto prose lg:prose-xl md:prose-lg"><img src=https://cdn4.aoe.com/typo3conf/ext/aoeweb_base/Resources/Public/Images/Logos/aoe_blue.svg class="basis-1/6 h-10"><div class="basis-5/6 text-gray-500 text-sm pl-4">AOE is a leading global provider of services for digital transformation and digital business models.
