Tailwind shines with to aspects:</p><p><em>First</em>, we get to focus on what CSS is designed to do. There are not buttons, no popups, only raw classes with minimal and well-defined features. Want to define a padding? Set <code>class="p-8"</code>. Want to decrease that? Change to <code>class="p-4"</code>. Easy, right?</p><p><em>Second</em>, Tailwind only compiles required classes, not everything. By statically analysing your code Tailwind ensures no useless classes are bundled, making sure that you always bring the bare minimum.</p><p>Being so simple with such a clear API, Tailwind even allows people with very few experience in frontend development to implement and adjust necessary components without breaking the whole design.</p><p>Did you notice? This website is built using Tailwind too!</p><p>Feeling adventorous? Try Tailwind together with React, and render everything on the server side using Remix. Now you&rsquo;ll feel the whole speed of what&rsquo;s possible on the web!</p></div></div></div><div class="container my-20 mx-auto"><img src=https://cdn4.aoe.com/typo3conf/ext/aoeweb_base/Resources/Public/Images/Logos/aoe_blue.svg class="h-10 float-left pr-4"><div class="text-gray-500 text-sm">AOE is a leading global provider of services for digital transformation and digital business models.
