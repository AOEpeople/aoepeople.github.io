description: "That's why AOE loves open source"

At AOE our most valuable asset is our experience with building complex enterprise applications to shape companies digital transformation, so why do we care about Open Source at all?
We grow by learning on new impulses, not by locking ourselves into our comfort zone.

That's why we believe in Open Source as a chance to steadily keep learning from each other, beyond our companies boundaries.

Over the past 20 years AOE's people were always heavily involved in all kinds of Open Source projects, as users, contributors, maintainers. Beyond code we keep organizing community meetups, share experiences on conferences and strive towards an open exchange about new topics, technologies and tools.

Take a look on our AOE Technology Radar if you are interested on technologies we find promising or have adopted in the recent years, and learn more why and how we decide on our tech stack. Of course, you find the source code on Github as well, check it out and build your own radar if you like.
